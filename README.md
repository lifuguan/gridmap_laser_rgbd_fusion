## map_img_proccess
@fuction: this is top model,rectified map by 3D obstacle.

@input  : map.yaml map.pgm,"/laser_pose","/keypoint_scan"

@output : rectified_map.pgm

## laser_rgbd_sonar_fusion
@fuction: fuse laser and rgbd,extra keypoint of 3D obstacle.

@input  : "/scan","/xtion_scan"

@output : "/keypoint_scan"

## depthimage_to_laserscan

@fuction: get 3D points from asus_xtion,get 2D scan by 3D points 
=project into x-y plan.

@input  : "depth/image"

@output : "/xtion_scan"
